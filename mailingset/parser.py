"""A simple top-down parser for Mailing Set operations.

This is based on the Pratt parser presented in the article "Simple Top-Down
Parsing in Python" at: http://effbot.org/zone/simple-top-down-parsing.htm

A Mailing Set operation is an arithmetic expression in which leaf nodes are
mailing list names and operators are _|_ for set union, _&_ for set
intersection, and _-_ for set difference. Curly braces { } are used for
parenthesization, which is REQUIRED when using more than one type of operator.

Examples:
    sf_&_{dog_|_cat}        San Franciscans who own a dog or a cat.
    {sf_&_dog}_|_cat        San Franciscan dog owners, and all cat owners.
    sf_&_dog_|_cat          INVALID due to missing parenthesization.
    sf_&_dog_&_cat          San Franciscans who own both a dog and a cat.
                            Parenthesization is not required for operators of
                            the same type.
    sf_-_dog_-_cat          San Franciscans who own neither a dog nor a cat. Set
                            difference is left associative.
    sf_-_{dog_-_cat}        San Franciscans, except those owning a dog but not a
                            cat.
    {sf_|_la}_&_dog_&_cat   People in SF or LA who own both dogs and cats.
